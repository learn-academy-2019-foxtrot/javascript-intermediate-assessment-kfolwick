# ASSESSMENT 3: INTERMEDIATE JAVASCRIPT
## Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.

1. What are the HTTP verbs? Which CRUD action corresponds to each verb?

  Your answer: Get, post, put, patch, delete/destroy. Create, read, update, delete/destroy

  Researched answer: In a PUT request, the enclosed entity is considered to be a modified version of the resource stored on the origin server, and the client is requesting that the stored version be replaced. With PATCH, however, the enclosed entity contains a set of instructions describing how a resource currently residing on the origin server should be modified to produce a new version. Also, another difference is that when you want to update a resource with PUT request, you have to send the full payload as the request whereas with PATCH, you only send the parameters which you want to update.


2. Why would you use object destructuring?

  Your answer: To make nested data more easily accessible.

  Researched answer: Destructuring an object allows you to take properties of an object and make them into individual variables.



3. Why is testing important?

  Your answer: Testing is important to ensure that your program is running the way you intend it to.

  Researched answer: Testing allows you to detect bugs early when developing a program.


4. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: A class is basically the container for objects.

  Researched answer: A class is a blueprint or template from which objects are created. An object is an instance of a class.


5. What did you learn during the group project this week? Please include any additional feedback you may have.

  Your answer: A lot. Not only did I get a lot more comfortable working with React, I also learned a lot of new methods that can be used such as setTimeout and window.location.reload.



### HTML/CSS Review questions: First, try to answer each question on your own then Google the answer to further your knowledge.

1. How do you link a CSS file to your HTML page?

  Your answer: use the link tag

  Researched answer: the link tag should be placed within the head section and after the title element on the HTML file.


2. What is the difference between a div and a span?

  Your answer: span is used for smaller bits of html, whereas a div is used for larger chunks

  Researched answer: A span element is an in-line element, used inside a line such as a paragraph. A div is a block-line element, which is basically equivalent to having a line-break before and after it.


3. What is a CSS class? When should you use an id instead of a class?

  Your answer: An ID can be used to identify one element, whereas a class can be used to identify more than one.

  Researched answer: Knowing when to use class over ID is important because your code will not pass validation if you use the same ID on more than one element.

  Your answer: header, footer, table, section

  Researched answer: Aside: intended for content that is not part of the flow of the text in which it appears, however still related in some way.
